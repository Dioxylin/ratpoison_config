# Some problems I have with ratpoison:
#
#   You can't just set a modifier key as a prefix.  I would like to just set
#   Super as my prefix key and be able to have all the normal keybinds as if it
#   were the prefix.
#
#   The workspaces implementation could use some work.
#
#   Mouse focus isn't really grand.  It forces the focus to always be over the
#   mouse, so if you change focus via keyboard, it switches to where the mouse
#   is focused, and it gets annoying quickly.  I guess "sloppy focus" is more
#   my kind of thing.
#
#   Can't set monitor directions so that you could just theoretically have a
#   semless screen.  I would like to have two monitors be one "screen" in
#   ratpoison, so I can juse move the frame selector left to go to the left
#   monitor.
#
#   Can't force gimp to not hide its windows on workspace switch.  Annoyimg as
#   hell, even though it seems like this should finally be THE perfect window
#   manager for the weird application since I can force frames to never change.
#   Does even work on chaste mode.
#
#   Sometimes trayer will stay in the middle of the screen on startup.  This is
#   probably a problem on my end.
